            <p class="text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                towards applicable relevance in the students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future
                society at large or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized
                by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable
                Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all. In most regions, education is compulsory
                up to a certain age.

            <p class="text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
                deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
                imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation,
                formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

            <p class="text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching
                students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple
                students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are
                designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such
                choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g.
                classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities,
                and more.

                The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical
                base to compare education systems. In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though the
                fields were later separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has 9 rather
                than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended
                the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development
                programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.
